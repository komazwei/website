In the world of instant information it is difficult to keep up to date with information that's relevant to our business.

Keeping track of all changes on contracts and updates to business processes can be complex task. Previously you would have to navigate through various forms and reports to get insight into changes that are important to you.

We've worked hard on a new feature that we've launched today: Activity Streams. We now post any changes to customers contracts and other business documents to your home page. You can now simply log-in to see changes and then decide if these require an action from yourself.</p>

You can also use the Activity Stream to conveniently post messages to colleagues or to your farming customers. Messages from colleagues and customers are also conveniently integrated into your Activity Stream.

We're planning some exciting updates to Activity Streams that will make keeping on-top-of activities in your business network even easier.
