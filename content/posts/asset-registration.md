Maps have always played an important role in farming. They show the invisible boundaries between you and your neighbours, they helped your ancestors divide family farms between their sons, they show the location of fields, orchards, rivers and dams, and now they can assist you in keeping a digital record of your assets.

This week, Agrista has released a mapping tool that allows farmers to view aerial maps of their farm and draw on boundaries, lands and pin point fixed assets. The beta version of the mapping tool is available, to registered users, as both a browser and tablet app. This tool makes it easy to list farm assets, locate them on a map and verify them with photos.

# It all starts with a farm map

Whether you are an individual farmer or an agri-business with a list of customers, the first step to registering your assets is to register a farmer profile on Agrista.
