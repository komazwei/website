Understanding the location of customers is critical in agriculture. We've launched tools that make it easy to visualise your customer base.

Many companies talk about their customer insight but rarely venture into doing something about gaining it. To draw up to date customer information from various nooks and crannies throughout your organisation is simply not as simple as it sounds.

Agrista has been working on this problem for what seems like the better part of a decade. And we feel we have created something irresistably easy that makes your customer base more accessible than you could imagine. We call it Wallmap.

Wallmap at its heart is geo-located customer relationship understanding coupled with your service areas and products. What it provides is facinating market analysis and levels of collaboration and cross-selling you have yet to see in your organistaion.</p>
