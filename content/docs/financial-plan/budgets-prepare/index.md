To forecast production income and expenses you will need to prepare a budget for each commodity your customer is producing. Budgets must be downloaded into your Agrista account for you to use them in a FRP. To prepare budgets you need to navigate to the **Enterprise Budgets** option in your Agrista account. A list of your existing budgets will display. 



Published Enterprise budgets can be cloned to create copies. You can then customise the budget and use it in your FRP.
Clone a **Blueprint** budget to start capturing an enterprise budget from scratch.

1. Select a published budget from your Enterprise Budget list
2. Click the Options button and choose Clone
3. Give the budget a name and click Save
