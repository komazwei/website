## Signing in as the administrator

During the Enterprise registration process, your company was required to nominate a primary contact. This person is automatically added into your Enterprise instance as the administrator.

## Managing Users

Your Enterprise account can be configured to accommodate your company's size and structure. Using user roles and organisation units you can restrict the features and customer groups that your users can have access to.


### Role manager

The Role Manager is a tool to control what users can and cannot do within the system, e.g. a manager would need access to the Reports feature, while field staff may only need access to the tasks feature. A user role is assigned to each user when their account is created. It grants them access to the basic system and controls which applications they will see on their main menu.
