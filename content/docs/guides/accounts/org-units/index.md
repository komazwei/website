## Organisational units

Organisational units are a means of arranging your users and customers into groups, based either on geographical regions or branches. Each Enterprise account is created with a single *Branch* and *Region*. These can be edited to include the whole scope of your business, or more branches and regions can be added to mirror your company's existing structure. 

**Branches**
These are physical locations where your business is conducted and your staff are located. 

**Regions**
These are geographical areas in which your customers are located. 

Place each user in the appropriate Branch and Region when they are created to ensure they have access to the correct customer lists.
