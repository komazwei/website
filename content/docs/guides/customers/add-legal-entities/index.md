## Legal entities

The Legal Entities tab on a customer portfolio lists all legal entities involved in the farming business. Farming business can have many different operational fronts, e.g. companies buying and selling products, trading names and private accounts for individuals. All of these different aspects of the farming business can be collected together under the legal entities tab.

The primary contact's details entered when creating a new customer portfolio automatically generated a legal entity.
