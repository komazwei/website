### Editing schedules

Schedules specify when a cost occurs. For instance if a crop budget starts in August, the costs associated with planting seed may occur from August to October. The Plant/Seed schedule can be set up to distribute these costs across the 3 months.

To create a new schedule:

1. On the Scheduling tab, click the **Options** button and select **Add Schedule**. The Add Schedule modal will open up.
2. Select a schedule action from the name drop down list and adjust the monthly sliders to allocate the costs associated with that action. When the cost allocation reaches 100% the Save button will activate.
3. Click Save
