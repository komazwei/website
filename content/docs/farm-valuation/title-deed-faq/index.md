# How do I add a legal entity to the drop down list?

The **Legal Entity** drop down list pulls the list of legal entities from the associated Customer Portfolio. Follow [these instructions](/docs/customers/legal-entity-add) to add the missing legal entity to the customer data.

Don't forget to click the **Done** button to save your changes before navigating away from this task.

# Why can't I see any portions listed in this task?

Title deed attachment spaces are only displayed for farm portions that are **Included** in a valuation request. Check your [Capture Property Location](/docs/farm-valuation/request-modify) task to make sure the missing portions have their **Include** toggle switched to **ON**.
