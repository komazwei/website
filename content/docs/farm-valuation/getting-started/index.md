Agrista has partnered with a number of top farm valuation companies in South Africa. Once a farm valuation request has been generated, a valuer will contact the client to arrange a farm visit. All data is collected electronically and checked for quality. Compiling a farm valuation report requires the completion of a few tasks. Each task relates to a section in the farm valuation report template. Once all task are finished the final report can be download as a pdf.

 1. request is generated 
 2. valuer performs a farm inspection
 3. data is captured in the tasks
 4. report is generated

# How is a farm valuation request generated?

Requests can either be [created](/docs/farm-valuation/request-create) within a valuation company's Agrista account, or they can be generated in a 3rd party account and [submitted](/docs/farm-valuation/request-receive) to a selected valuation company.
