You can also judge the portfolios level of completeness by seeing if the customer's basic information has been captured. Basic information is required for the customer portfolio to contribute to your company's Management Reports and is defined as follows:

- Capture customer segmentation - management reports can be filtered by farming operation type
- Capture homestead location - the Wall Map feature shows your company's geographic footprint and requires that each portfolio contains a homestead marker
- Locate farm portions -
