### Contact Person


Every customer portfolio requires a primary contact. By entering in these details on a new customer portfolio, a legal entity is automatically created.

### Customer Details 

For medium to large companies, customers can be allocated to different internal organisation units, or Org. Units. These are often separated by geographical regions, i.e. province or magisterial districts. 

	To learn more about structuring your Enterprise account with organisation units check out :doc:`../overview/administration`

### Customer segmentation


Customers can also be segmented into their farming size, i.e.

* Smallholder: Small farm, limited production
* Commercial: large scale agricultural production
* Recreational: Leisure or hobby farming

Their total annual turnover can be captured, as well as their farming enterprises.

## Farm Map

Adding information about a customer's farms, fields, and other assets is done with the Farm Map tab on the customer portfolio.

### Farms

## Define land use

Fields comprise the base of your customers' farms by dividing the farmland into different land use sectors. After creating fields, assets such as Crops, Livestock, Improvements and others can be added in the appropriate fields.

* Grazing
* Horticulture
* Housing
* Plantation
* Planted pastures
* Structures
* Utilities
* Wasteland
* Conservation

2. Click Add and then click Field.
3. Using the polygon tool on the map, draw the boundaries of the field.
4. Add in the relevant information and click Save.
