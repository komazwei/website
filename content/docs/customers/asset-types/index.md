Assets are captured in a customer portfolio. They are owned by a person or company, i.e. a legal entity in the customer portfolio. They can be current or past assets.

Assets are categorised into  the following types:

- [Land assets](/docs/assets/farmland)
- [Fixed assets](/docs/assets/improvements)
- [Movable assets](/docs/assets/livestock)
- [Seasonal assets](/docs/assets/crops)

Assets are allocated to farms by the local farm name. It is possible to transfer assets between farms and legal entities.
