#### Allocate Farm Land Use

We developed this useful tool for easily capturing the value of the customer's farmland. It also generates the land assets that are needed for production planning.
This only needs to be done once per customer and will pull through to each subsequent FRP document.

1. Select **Allocate Farm Land Use** from the Toolbox menu
2. Click the Plus button to add additional land use categories
3. Add a value for each category
4. Click Save

#### Define Enterprises

This tool combines the land components with the budgets you have prepared. Each land component can have one or many budgets applied to it to forecast the customer's expected production schedule.

1. Select **Define Enterprises** from the Toolbox menu. The system will automatically list the land components created in the previous step.
2. Click the Plus button to apply a budget to a land category, i.e crop budgets to cropland and livestock budgets to grazing. A list of available budgets will appear in the drop down list. You can edit the income assumptions pulled through from the budgets.
3. Move the blue time marker in the timeline to add budgets to Year 1 and Year 2 of the FRP
4. Click Save

Livestock sales will pull through from the budget, but additional breeding stock figures can be added by selecting them from the Commodity drop down list.

#### Add Production Credit

Capture all sources of production credit available to the customer.

1. Select **Edit Production Credit** from the Toolbox menu. The system will automatically list the expenses created in the previous step.
2. Enter in the details of the credit provider. If the credit provider you need is not in the Creditor drop down list, please send me an email and I will add it for you.
3. Adjust the covered enterprises and expenses buttons to modify the required funding from this creditor. Note that although the required funding my be more than the set credit limit, the system will not cover any additional expenses once the credit limit has been reached. Each expense has a date associated with it and expenses occurring first will be allocated to the creditor first.
4. Add any planned repayments, including the value and date of crop payments. Remember to click the plus button on the repayment for it to be saved.
5. Click Save
