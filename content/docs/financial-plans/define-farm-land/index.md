We developed this useful tool for easily capturing the value of the customer's farmland. It also generates the land assets that are needed for production planning.
This only needs to be done once per customer and will pull through to each subsequent FRP document.

1. Select **Allocate Farm Land Use** from the Toolbox menu.

The **Farm Land Use** modal will open and automatically classify the customer's farm's into general land use categories based on satellite imagery.

Areas that cannot be easily classified are assigned to the *Homestead & Wasteland* category. This auto-classification canbe modified:

2. Click the **Plus** button in the header line of the **Land Use** table. A list of land categories will open.
3. Select the land use category you would like to add.

##### Notes

The structure of the customer's farm data will affect how this tool displays the Land Use categories. For instance:

- Multiple farms are displayed in different tabs
