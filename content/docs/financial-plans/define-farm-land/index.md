#### Allocate Farm Land Use

We developed this useful tool for easily capturing the value of the customer's farmland. It also generates the land assets that are needed for production planning.
This only needs to be done once per customer and will pull through to each subsequent FRP document.

1. Select **Allocate Farm Land Use** from the Toolbox menu
2. Click the Plus button to add additional land use categories
3. Add a value for each category
4. Click Save
