#### Define Enterprises

This tool combines the land components with the budgets you have prepared. Each land component can have one or many budgets applied to it to forecast the customer's expected production schedule.

1. Select **Define Enterprises** from the Toolbox menu. The system will automatically list the land components created in the previous step.
2. Click the Plus button to apply a budget to a land category, i.e crop budgets to cropland and livestock budgets to grazing. A list of available budgets will appear in the drop down list. You can edit the income assumptions pulled through from the budgets.
3. Move the blue time marker in the timeline to add budgets to Year 1 and Year 2 of the FRP
4. Click Save

Livestock sales will pull through from the budget, but additional breeding stock figures can be added by selecting them from the Commodity drop down list.
