## Define Enterprises

This tool combines the land components with the budgets you have prepared. Each land component can have one or many budgets applied to it to forecast the customer's expected production revenue.

1. Select **Define Enterprises** from the Toolbox menu. The system will automatically list the land components created in the previous step.

3. Click the **Plus** button on a land component to apply a budget to it. A list of available budgets will appear in the drop down list, i.e crop budgets on cropland and livestock budgets on grazing.
