Agrista accounts are currently created by invitation only. Our partners can send you an invitation, if you are in their customer list, or you can send us an email and we will create your account for you. You can find our contact details [here](/contact).

You will get an email with a link to activate your new account.

A member of our support team will be on hand to help you set up your new account.
