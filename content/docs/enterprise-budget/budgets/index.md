To create a budget on Agrista you will need to make an editable version of an existing budget. This is called *cloning* a budget. All published budgets can be cloned. Clone a **Blueprint** budget to start capturing an enterprise budget from scratch.

You can clone a budget from your budget list if you have already added a few favourites, or you can clone a budget directly from the search list.

1. Select a *public* budget from your budget list
2. Click the **Options** button and choose **Clone**

or,

1. Click the **Browse** button at the top of your budget list.
2. Set the search filters to find the right type of budget and click the **Clone** button on the budget card.

A budget modal will open where you can customise some of the budget's details:

- Give the budget a **name**
- Click on the map to change the budget's **region**
- Update the budget's **assumptions**

More information is available [here](../assumptions/)
4. Click the **Save** button.
